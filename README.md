## Executive Summary

**NursePath** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed as an **academic learning tool** for nursing students. The application serves as a digital study companion that reinforces textbook concepts taught in the classroom.

This project addresses two educational objectives:

1. **Concept Reinforcement** — Provides interactive examples of drug dosage calculations and IV flow rate formulas that mirror textbook exercises, helping students practice and internalize mathematical nursing concepts.

2. **Reference Accessibility** — Offers a searchable compilation of commonly discussed OTC medications and vital signs ranges, serving as a portable study reference similar to pocket nursing guides.

The application operates entirely offline after initial installation, making it convenient for studying in various environments including libraries, dormitories, or areas with limited connectivity.

**Important:** This is a learning reinforcement tool, not a clinical resource. All content reflects standard nursing textbook material and is intended to support classroom instruction, not replace it.
